caption: 'The conservation plots of transcription factor (ChIP-seq) runs typically show a high focal point around peak summits (characterized as "needle points"), while histone runs typically show bi
modal peaks (characterized as "shoulders"). Further downstream ananlyses, including regulatory potential scores derived from LISA, are also written to a subfolder for each sample in the report directory.'
