caption: 'The conservation plots of transcription factor (ChIP-seq) runs typically show a high focal point around peak summits (characterized as "needle points"), while histone runs typically show bimodal peaks (characterized as "shoulders"). For motif analysis, the top 5000 most significant peak summits (ranked by the MACS P-value) are written to a subfolder for each sample in the report directory. Though several motifs typically arise for each sample, only the top hit is shown here. Further downstream analyses, including regulatory potential scores derived from LISA, are also available for each sample in the report directory.'
